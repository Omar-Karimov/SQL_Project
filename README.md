and Password in this system. In this way, will be gathering information about the employee who has booked or sold a ticket.

By creating a unique ID for each intercity trip on different days and times; the name of the route, the Date and Time of the Expedition, with which Bus the Expedition will be made,
the Brand, Model and Seat Number of the bus will also be entered into the automation system as expedition information.

However, the customer may want to get off at a different point on the start and end route of an expedition.
